# Sonic Boom project for Fantom Network

A project to use the power of Fantom Sonic to build game.

Don't lose time when you interact with blockchain on your game, with Sonic boom Api you can mint, transfer, send transaction with a response in less than 1 sec on Fantom blockchain.

You can retrieve data in less than 100 ms.

Sonic Boom's aim is to integrate blockchain into games requiring low ping and real-time interaction. You can't ask your user to wait between 2 and 30 seconds every time you make a transaction on the blockchain, you'd risk losing them.
