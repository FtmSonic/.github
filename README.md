# Sonic Boom project for Fantom Network

A project to use the power of Fantom Sonic to build game.

Don't lose time when you interact with blockchain on your game, with Sonic boom Api you can mint, transfer, send transaction with a response in less than 1 sec on Fantom blockchain.

You can retrieve data in less than 100 ms.

Sonic Boom's aim is to integrate blockchain into games requiring low ping and real-time interaction. You can't ask your user to wait between 2 and 30 seconds every time you make a transaction on the blockchain, you'd risk losing them.


## Why Sonic Boom

There are many SDKs and marketplaces for integrating blockchain into video games, but none of them are complete. Some only manage the marketplace part, others only integrate a custodial wallet, and for most of them the response time is more or less long when the user needs to submit a transaction to the blockchain.

SonicBoom puts an end to all these problems, with a complete sdk that leaves users free to integrate a custodial solution or not, to use our platform to create their tokens/nfts/marketplaces/swap or to use their own contracts, save time during development and above all enjoy ultra-fast response times thanks to Sonic Fantom when interacting with the blockchain, making it transparent to the end user.
